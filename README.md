## Abstract
The outbreak of COVID-19 has created a serious public health concern worldwide. Although, most of the regions around the globe have been affected by COVID-19 infections; some regions are more badly affected in terms of infections and fatality rates than others. The exact reasons for such variations are not clear yet. As a preventive measure, lockdown was imposed by most governments around the world leading to changes in human activities in all aspects of life as well as in the environment. This review discussed the possible effects of air pollution on COVID-19 infections and mortality based on some recent evidence as well as the possible effects of the quarantine on air pollution. While we didn't find a significant correlation between the exposure to air pollution and the mortality rate, we found out that due to the lockdown air pollution has decreased.
